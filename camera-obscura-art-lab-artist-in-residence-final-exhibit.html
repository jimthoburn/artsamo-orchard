<h2>Chuck Hohng and <span style="display: inline-block;">Matt Reynolds:</span> <em style="display: inline-block;">New Works</em></h2>
<p data-style="text-align: justify;">Santa Monica Cultural Affairs&nbsp;is proud to present <em>Chuck Hohng and Matt Reynolds: New Works</em>, the culminating exhibit of work created between June and August 2020 as part of their residencies at the <span style="display: inline-block;">Camera Obscura Art Lab.</span></p>
<p>During their studio residencies, Chuck Hohng and Matt Reynolds meditated on making &ldquo;the concrete&rdquo; both kinetic and pliable and examined ideas of cultural heritage and identity, structures of authority and supremacy, origin stories, tradition and evolution.</p>
<p style="grid-column: 2/-1; grid-row: span 1; padding-left: 0; justify-self: start;"><img alt="" src="https://www.santamonica.gov/Media/arts/CA/COAL/Chuck%20and%20Matt%20Composite%20for%20Web%20Page%20Final%20Exhibit%20small.png" width="818" height="305" /></p>
<p>For his <em>Ghotjip</em> <em>Series</em>, Chuck Hohng designed traditional Korean funeral clothes and funeral rituals inspired by hanboks. In reference to the pandemic we are living through,&nbsp;<em>Ghotjip</em>, a community housing unit for hearses in Korea, was a sacred place of bonding between the family of the deceased and the towns people who helped them grieve. In addition to his <em>Ghotjip</em> <em>Series</em>, Chuck employed the traditional Korean theater forms, Talchum and Madangnori in developing <em>Norujoen</em>, a performance piece exploring the Korean diaspora in conjunction with oral histories of the Korean War.</p>
<p>Matt Reynolds continued his exploration of animated sculpture, integrating the tactile corporeality of his previous sculptural work with animated motion.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>During the residency Matt experimented with salvaged packaging and building materials to create hybrid forms that live somewhere between the familiar urban landscape of Los Angeles and the realm of cartoons.</p>

<p>Korean American Artist&nbsp;<em><strong>Chuck Hohng</strong></em>&nbsp;was born in Long Beach, California, but spent most of his early life growing up in his family's native home in South Korea. He received his undergraduate degree in Fine Art from the University of Southern California and received his Master of Fine Arts from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. His work has been exhibited both domestically and internationally including Los Angeles, City of Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, San Francisco, Paris, London, Dubai, Osaka, Gwangju, and Busan. Not willing to settle on just one form of media, his art pieces run the gambit from intricate reductive linoleum prints, to giant 10 foot bears composed of canvas drop cloths and balloons, to haunting videos. His ongoing project Knoxon Dahl, which phonetically means 'Rusted Moon' in Korean, explores multicultural identity, memory and the parallel existence of American and Korean in his cultural&nbsp;consciousness.

<p data-style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<h3>Residency Description</h3>
<p data-style="text-align: justify;">The City of Santa Monica established the Studio Residency Program at the Camera Obscura to support the work of local artists and artisans, highlight the intersection of fine art and craft, and provide the public with access to a variety of artistic practices and instruction in an online workshop format. The Studio Residency spans over three months and three terms are available each year. The selection panel selects two individual artists, OR one collective, OR a combination of individuals and collectives for each term. An honorarium accompanies the residency. The City offers this opportunity to artists who need a place to create and are invested in sharing their work through online workshops and an online exhibit for public benefit. Applications are reviewed by a committee of arts professionals.&nbsp;The residency is open to all artists, artisans and makers who reside in Los Angeles County. A Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued each fall for the coming year.&nbsp; The link to the RFP will be included in the Santa Monica Cultural Affairs eblast. You can sign up to receive our eblasts by clicking on the Stay-Up-To-Date button at the top of this page.</p>

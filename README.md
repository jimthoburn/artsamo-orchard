# Santa Monica Cultural Affairs

Supporting files for the Santa Monica Cultural Affairs website, built with [Orchard CMS](https://orchardproject.net/)

These are CSS and JS files, which are convenient to manage on GitHub. They’re published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and then loaded from the website…

The stylesheet link looks like this:
```
<link href="https://jimthoburn.github.io/artsamo-orchard/assets/css/site.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

And the JavaScript is loaded this way:
```
<script src="https://jimthoburn.github.io/artsamo-orchard/assets/js/shim.js"></script>
<script src="https://jimthoburn.github.io/artsamo-orchard/assets/js/events.js"></script>
```
